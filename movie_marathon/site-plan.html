      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p> You open the doors, shaking with excitement for the midnight release of
        the final movie to the series you have been following for years. You
        smell the fresh scent of popcorn, candy, and nachos. You hear laughing
        and arcade games popping off in the background. You go to the booth and
        get yourself a soda pop and a popcorn ready to witness this masterpiece
        you have been waiting months for. You turn in your ticket, find a
        perfect spot, and are ready to watch this movie. You look up and you see
        your room’s ceiling. You hear your annoying alarm yelling in your ear
        for you to get up! You dreamt it. You were not there, but you cannot
        stop thinking about getting there to watch this cinematic masterpiece
        but can-not decide where to go see it. No issue here with Movie Marathon
        where anyone can go online to our website and buy your tickets and seats
        anywhere. Remove the stress of hoping there’s tickets left and long
        lines. Move Marathon has you covered with everything one can need to
        jump into their world of movies.

        be taken care of for you and organized into a smooth and easy way of
        understanding.</p>  <!-- change this -->
