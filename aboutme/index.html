    <p>Hey everyone it is good to get started in this class with you all. Dont ask me why my nickname is Wyatt, it's a long story. I am starting my degree in Computer Science. I first got interested into Computer Science after I built my first pc right before Covid hit. After that I was interested in learning more and more. 
        <p>I love to play basically any sport as long as it is competive. I also love playing video games with my homies. Some of my favorites are Rocket League, Valorant, and Destiny 2. Hit me up if you play any of the games and maybe we could play sometime.</p> 
            <p>I am from the Seattle Washington area, but just 30 minutes south of Seattle. I love Washington because of the beautiful outdoors and rain. Believe it or not I love the rain and the comfort it brings.</p>
